## La Masia de Jose Luis

Fully refurbished and inaugurated in the year 2003, the elegance of La Masia is present in each and every one of its corners. All thanks to the prestigious interior designer Pascua Ortega, who has designed each of the lounges. Elegant and comfortable spaces for any celebration that needs personality, quality and social brilliance.

The event will be celebrated at the Viewpoint room, located on the top floor of the farmhouse and has a capacity for 120 people seated. The main feature of the Viewpoint Room, in addition to its subtlety, is that it communicates with the Fireplace Lounge (where an after-dinner “discotheque” could be set up) thus giving guests the possibility to choose between one ambiance and the other.

In addition, La Masía has a cosy Mediterranean-style restaurant that offers a delicious menu of modernised-traditional cuisine, with succulent dishes for you to enjoy in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.
